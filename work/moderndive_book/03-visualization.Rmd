We begin the development of your data science toolbox with data visualization. By visualizing our data, we will be able to gain valuable insights from our data that we couldn't initially see from just looking at the raw data in spreadsheet form.  We will use the `ggplot2` package as it provides an easy way to customize your plots and is rooted in the data visualization theory known as _The Grammar of Graphics_ [@wilkinson2005].

At the most basic level, graphics/plots/charts (we use these terms interchangeably in this book) provide a nice way for us to get a sense for how quantitative variables compare in terms of their center (where the values tend to be located) and their spread (how they vary around the center).  The most important thing to know about graphics is that they should be created to make it obvious for your audience to understand the findings and insight you want to get across.  This does however require a balancing act.  On the one hand, you want to highlight as many meaningful relationships and interesting findings as possible, but on the other you don't want to include so many as to overwhelm your audience.  

As we will see, plots/graphics also help us to identify patterns and outliers in our data.  We will see that a common extension of these ideas is to compare the *distribution* of one quantitative variable (i.e., what the spread of a variable looks like or how the variable is *distributed* in terms of its values) as we go across the levels of a different categorical variable.

Our approach to introducing data visualization via the Grammar of Graphics and the `ggplot2` package is very similar to the approach taken in [David Robinson's](https://twitter.com/drob) DataCamp course "Introduction to the Tidyverse," a course targeted at people new to R and the tidyverse. If you're interested in complementing your learning below in an interactive online environment, click on the image below to access the course.

```




## The Grammar of Graphics {#grammarofgraphics}

We begin with a discussion of a theoretical framework for data visualization known as the "The Grammar of Graphics," which serves as the basis for the `ggplot2` package.  Much like how we construct sentences in any language by using a linguistic grammar (nouns, verbs, subjects, objects, etc.), the theoretical framework given by Leland Wilkinson [@wilkinson2005] allows us to specify the components of a statistical graphic.

### Components of the Grammar

In short, the grammar tells us that:

> **A statistical graphic is a `mapping` of `data` variables to `aes`thetic attributes of `geom`etric objects.**

Specifically, we can break a graphic into the following three essential components:

1. `data`: the data-set comprised of variables that we map.
1. `geom`: the geometric object in question. This refers to our type of objects we can observe in our plot. For example, points, lines, bars, etc.
1. `aes`: aesthetic attributes of the geometric object that we can perceive on a graphic. For example, x/y position, color, shape, and size.  Each assigned aesthetic attribute can be mapped to a variable in our data-set.

Let's break down the grammar with an example.

### Gapminder {#gapminder}

```{r, echo=FALSE}
gapminder_2007 <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2007) %>% 
  select(-year) %>% 
  rename(
    Country = country,
    Continent = continent,
    `Life Expectancy` = lifeExp,
    `Population` = pop,
    `GDP per Capita` = gdpPercap
  )
```

In February 2006, a statistician named Hans Rosling gave a TED talk titled ["The best stats you've ever seen"](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen) where he presented global economic, health, and development data from the website [gapminder.org](http://www.gapminder.org/tools/#_locale_id=en;&chart-type=bubbles). For example, from the `r nrow(gapminder)` countries included from 2007, consider only the first 6 countries when listed alphabetically:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
gapminder_2007 %>% 
  head() %>% 
  kable(
    digits=2,
    caption = "Gapminder 2007 Data: First 6 of 142 countries", 
    booktabs = TRUE
  ) %>% 
  kable_styling(font_size = ifelse(knitr:::is_latex_output(), 10, 16),
                latex_options = c("HOLD_position"))
```

Each row in this table corresponds to a country in 2007. For each row, we have 5 columns:

1. **Country**: Name of country.
1. **Continent**: Which of the five continents the country is part of. (Note that `Americas` groups North and South America and that Antarctica is excluded here.)
1. **Life Expectancy**: Life expectancy in years.
1. **Population**: Number of people living in the country.
1. **GDP per Capita**: Gross domestic product (in US dollars).

Now consider Figure \@ref(fig:gapminder), which plots this data for all `r nrow(gapminder_2007)` countries in the data frame. Note that R will deal with large numbers using scientific notation.  So in the legend for "Population", 1.25e+09 = $1.25 \times 10^{9}$ = 1,250,000,000 = 1.25 billion. 

```{r gapminder, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Life Expectancy over GDP per Capita in 2007"}
ggplot(data = gapminder_2007, mapping = aes(x=`GDP per Capita`, y=`Life Expectancy`, size=Population, col=Continent)) +
  geom_point()
```

Let's view this plot through the grammar of graphics:

1. The `data` variable **GDP per Capita** gets mapped to the `x`-position `aes`thetic of the points.
1. The `data` variable **Life Expectancy** gets mapped to the `y`-position `aes`thetic of the points.
1. The `data` variable **Population** gets mapped to the `size` `aes`thetic of the points.
1. The `data` variable **Continent** gets mapped to the `color` `aes`thetic of the points.

Recall that `data` here corresponds to each of the variables being in the same `data` frame and the "data variable" corresponds to a column in a data frame.

While in this example we are considering one type of `geom`etric object (of type `point`), graphics are not limited to just points. Some plots involve lines while others involve bars. Let's summarize the three essential components of the grammar in a table:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
map <- data_frame(
  `data variable` = c("GDP per Capita", "Life Expectancy", "Population", "Continent"),
  aes = c("x", "y", "size", "color"),
  geom = c("point", "point", "point", "point")
)

map %>% 
  kable(
    caption = "Summary of Grammar of Graphics for this plot", 
    booktabs = TRUE
    ) %>% 
  kable_styling(font_size = ifelse(knitr:::is_latex_output(), 10, 16),
                latex_options = c("HOLD_position"))
```

### Other components of the Grammar

There are other components of the Grammar of Graphics we can control.  As you start to delve deeper into the Grammar of Graphics, you'll start to encounter these topics more and more often. In this book, we'll only work with the two other components below (The other components are left to a more advanced text such as [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html#aesthetic-mappings) [@rds2016]):

- `facet`ing breaks up a plot into small multiples corresponding to the levels of another variable (Section \@ref(facets))
- `position` adjustments for barplots (Section \@ref(geombar))
<!--
- `scales` that both
    + convert *data units* to *physical units* the computer can display. For example, apply a log-transformation on one of the axes to focus on multiplicative rather than additive changes.
    + draw a legend and/or axes, which provide an inverse mapping to make it possible to read the original data values from the graph.
- `coord`inate system for x/y values: typically `cartesian`, but can also be `map` or `polar`.
- `stat`istical transformations: this includes smoothing, binning values into a histogram, or no transformation at all (known as the `"identity"` transformation).
-->

In general, the Grammar of Graphics allows for a high degree of customization and also a consistent framework for easy updating/modification of plots.

### The ggplot2 package

In this book, we will be using the `ggplot2` package for data visualization, which is an implementation of the Grammar of Graphics for R [@R-ggplot2]. You may have noticed that a lot of the previous text in this chapter is written in computer font. This is because the various components of the Grammar of Graphics are specified in the `ggplot` function, which expects at a bare minimum as arguments:

* The data frame where the variables exist: the `data` argument
* The mapping of the variables to aesthetic attributes: the `mapping` argument, which specifies the `aes`thetic attributes involved

After we've specified these components, we then add *layers* to the plot using the `+` sign. The most essential layer to add to a plot is the specification of which type of `geom`etric object we want the plot to involve; e.g. points, lines, bars. Other layers we can add include the specification of the plot title, axes labels, facets, and visual themes for the plot.

Let's now put the theory of the Grammar of Graphics into practice.

<!--
The plot given above is not a histogram, but the output does show us a bit of what is going on with `ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = temp))`.  It is producing a backdrop onto which we will "paint" elements.  We next proceed by adding a layer---hence, the use of the `+` symbol---to the plot to produce a histogram.  (Note also here that we don't have to specify the `data = ` and `mapping = ` text in our function calls.  This is covered in more detail in Chapter 5 of the "Getting Used to R, RStudio, and R Markdown" book [@usedtor2016]).

## Five Named Graphs - The 5NG {#FiveNG}

For our purposes, we will be limiting consideration to five different types of graphs.  We term these five named graphs the **5NG**:

1. scatterplots
1. linegraphs
1. boxplots
1. histograms
1. barplots

We will discuss some variations of these plots, but with this basic repertoire in your toolbox you can visualize a wide array of different data variable types. Note that certain plots are only appropriate for categorical/logical variables and others only for quantitative variables. You'll want to quiz yourself often as we go along on which plot makes sense a given a particular problem or data-set.






<!--Subsection on scatter plots-->
## 5NG#1: Scatterplots {#scatterplots}

The simplest of the 5NG are *scatterplots* (also called bivariate plots); they allow you to investigate the relationship between two numerical variables. While you may already be familiar with this type of plot, let's view it through the lens of the Grammar of Graphics. Specifically, we will graphically investigate the relationship between the following two numerical variables in the `flights` data frame:

1. `dep_delay`: departure delay on the horizontal "x" axis and
1. `arr_delay`: arrival delay on the vertical "y" axis

for Alaska Airlines flights leaving NYC in 2013. This requires paring down the data from all 336,776 flights that left NYC in 2013, to only the 714 *Alaska Airlines* flights that left NYC in 2013.

What this means computationally is: we'll take the `flights` data frame, extract only the 714 rows corresponding to Alaska Airlines flights, and save this in a new data frame called `alaska_flights`. Run the code below in your console to do this: 

```{r}
alaska_flights <- flights %>% 
  filter(carrier == "AS")
```

For now we suggest you ignore how this code works; we'll explain this in detail in Chapter \@ref(wrangling) when we cover data wrangling. However, convince yourself that this code does what it is supposed to by running `View(alaska_flights)` in the console: it creates a new data frame `alaska_flights` consisting of only the 714 Alaska Airlines flights.

We'll see later in Chapter \@ref(wrangling) on data wrangling that this code uses the `dplyr` package for data wrangling to achieve our goal: it takes the `flights` data frame and `filter`s it to only return the rows where `carrier` is equal to `"AS"`, Alaska Airlines' carrier code. Other examples of carrier codes include "AA" for American Airlines and "UA" for United Airlines. Recall from Section \@ref(code) that testing for equality is specified with `==` and not `=`. Fasten your seat belts and sit tight for now however, we'll introduce these ideas more fully in Chapter \@ref(wrangling).

```{block lc-alaska_flights, type='learncheck', purl=FALSE}
**_Learning check_**
```

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`**  Take a look at both the `flights` and `alaska_flights` data frames by running `View(flights)` and `View(alaska_flights)` in the console. In what respect do these data frames differ?

```{asis lc-alaska_flights-solutions, include=show_solutions('3-1')}
**Learning Check Solutions**  
**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc), ")")`**: `flights` contains all flight data, while `alaska_flights` contains only data from Alaskan carrier "AS". We can see that flights has `r nrow(flights)` rows while `alaska_flights` has only `r nrow(alaska_flights)`
```

```{block, type='learncheck', purl=FALSE}
```

### Scatterplots via geom_point {#geompoint}

We proceed to create the scatterplot using the `ggplot()` function:

```{r noalpha, fig.cap="Arrival Delays vs Departure Delays for Alaska Airlines flights from NYC in 2013", message=TRUE}
ggplot(data = alaska_flights, 
       mapping = aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay)) + 
  geom_point()
```

In Figure \@ref(fig:noalpha) we see that a positive relationship exists between `dep_delay` and `arr_delay`: as departure delays increase, arrival delays tend to also increase.  We also note that the majority of points fall near the point (0, 0).  There is a large mass of points clustered there. Furthermore after executing this code, R returns a warning message alerting us to the fact that 5 rows were ignored due to missing values. For 5 rows either the value for `dep_delay` or `arr_delay` or both were missing, and thus these rows were ignored in our plot.

Let's go back to the `ggplot()` function call that created this visualization, keeping in mind our discussion in Section \@ref(grammarofgraphics):

* Within the `ggplot()` function call, we specify two of the components of the grammar:
    1. The `data` frame to be `alaska_flights` by setting `data = alaska_flights`
    1. The `aes`thetic `mapping` by setting `aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay)`. Specifically
        * the variable `dep_delay` maps to the `x` position aesthetic
        * the variable `arr_delay` maps to the `y` position aesthetic
* We add a layer to the `ggplot()` function call using the `+` sign. The layer in question specifies the third component of the grammar:  the `geom`etric object. In this case the geometric object are `point`s, set by specifying `geom_point()`.

Some notes on layers:

* Note that the `+` sign comes at the end of lines, and not at the beginning.  You'll get an error in R if you put it at the beginning.
* When adding layers to a plot, you are encouraged to hit *Return* on your keyboard after entering the `+` so that the code for each layer is on a new line.  As we add more and more layers to plots, you'll see this will greatly improve the legibility of your code.
* To stress the importance of adding layers, in particular the layer specifying the `geom`etric object, consider Figure \@ref(fig:nolayers) where no layers are added. A not very useful plot!

```{r nolayers, fig.cap="Plot with No Layers"}
ggplot(data = alaska_flights, 
       mapping = aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay))
```


```{block lc-scatterplots, type='learncheck', purl=FALSE}
**_Learning check_**
```

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`**  What are some practical reasons why `dep_delay` and `arr_delay` have a positive relationship?

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`**  What variables (not necessarily in the `flights` data frame) would you expect to have a negative correlation (i.e. a negative relationship) with `dep_delay`? Why? Remember that we are focusing on numerical variables here.

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** Why do you believe there is a cluster of points near (0, 0)? What does (0, 0) correspond to in terms of the Alaskan flights?

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** What are some other features of the plot that stand out to you?

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** Create a new scatterplot using different variables in the `alaska_flights` data frame by modifying the example above.

```{asis lc-scatterplots-solutions, include=show_solutions('3-2')}
**Learning Check Solutions**  
**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc - 4), ")")`**: The later a plane departs, typically the later it will arrive.

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc - 3), ")")`**: An example in the `weather` dataset is `visibility`, which measure visibility in miles. As visibility increases, we would expect departure delays to decrease. 

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc - 2), ")")`**: The point (0,0) means no delay in departure nor arrival. From the point of view of Alaska airlines, this means the flight was on time. It seems most flights are at least close to being on time.

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc - 1), ")")`**: Different people will answer this one differently. One answer is most flights depart and arrive less than an hour late. 

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc), ")")`**: Many possibilities for this one, see the plot below. Is there a pattern in departure delay depending on when the flight is scheduled to depart? Interestingly, there seems to be only two blocks of time where flights depart.  
```

``` {r, include=show_solutions('3-2'), echo=show_solutions('3-2')}
ggplot(data = alaska_flights, mapping = aes(x = dep_time, y = dep_delay)) +
  geom_point()
```

```{block, type='learncheck', purl=FALSE}
```

### Over-plotting {#overplotting}

The large mass of points near (0, 0) in Figure \@ref(fig:noalpha) can cause some confusion.  This is the result of a phenomenon called *overplotting*.  As one may guess, this corresponds to values being plotted on top of each other _over_ and _over_ again.  It is often difficult to know just how many values are plotted in this way when looking at a basic scatterplot as we have here. There are two ways to address this issue:

1. By adjusting the transparency of the points via the `alpha` argument
1. By jittering the points via `geom_jitter()`

The first way of relieving overplotting is by changing the `alpha` argument in `geom_point()` which controls the transparency of the points.  By default, this value is set to `1`.  We can change this to any value between `0` and `1` where `0` sets the points to be 100% transparent and `1` sets the points to be 100% opaque. Note how the following function call is identical to the one in Section \@ref(scatterplots), but with `alpha = 0.2` added to the `geom_point()`.

```{r alpha, fig.cap="Delay scatterplot with alpha=0.2"}
ggplot(data = alaska_flights, 
       mapping = aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2)
```

The key feature to note in Figure \@ref(fig:alpha) is that the transparency of the points is cumulative: areas with a high-degree of overplotting are darker, whereas areas with a lower degree are less dark. 

Note that there is no `aes()` surrounding `alpha = 0.2` here.  Since we are NOT mapping a variable to an aesthetic but instead are just changing a setting, we don't need to create a mapping with `aes()`.  In fact, you'll receive an error if you try to change the second line above to `geom_point(aes(alpha = 0.2))`.

The second way of relieving overplotting is to *jitter* the points a bit. In other words, we are going to add just a bit of random noise to the points to better see them and alleviate some of the overplotting.  You can think of "jittering" as shaking the points around a bit on the plot. Let's illustrate using a simple example first. Say we have a data frame `jitter_example` with 4 rows of identical value 0 for both `x` and `y`:

```{r jitter-example-df, echo=FALSE}
jitter_example <- data_frame(
  x = c(0, 0, 0, 0),
  y = c(0, 0, 0, 0)
)
```
```{r jitter-example-df-01}
jitter_example
```

We display the resulting scatterplot in Figure \@ref(fig:jitter-example-plot-1); observe that the 4 points are superimposed on top of each other. While we know there are 4 values being plotted, this fact might not be apparent to others.

```{r jitter-example-plot-1, fig.cap="Regular scatterplot of jitter example data", echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = jitter_example, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) + 
  geom_point() +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-0.025, 0.025), ylim = c(-0.025, 0.025)) + 
  labs(title = "Regular scatterplot")
```

In Figure \@ref(fig:jitter-example-plot-2) we instead display a *jittered scatterplot*. Since each point is given a random "nudge", it is now plainly evident that there are four points. 

```{r jitter-example-plot-2, fig.cap="Jittered scatterplot of jitter example data", echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = jitter_example, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) + 
  geom_jitter(width = 0.01, height = 0.01) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-0.025, 0.025), ylim = c(-0.025, 0.025)) + 
  labs(title = "Jittered scatterplot")
```

To create a jittered scatterplot, instead of using `geom_point`, we use `geom_jitter`. To specify how much jitter to add, we adjust the `width` and `height` arguments.  This corresponds to how hard you'd like to shake the plot in units corresponding to those for both the horizontal and vertical variables (in this case, minutes). It is important to add just enough jitter to break any overlap in points, but not so much that we completely obscure the overall pattern in points. 

```{r jitter, fig.cap="Jittered delay scatterplot"}
ggplot(data = alaska_flights, 
       mapping = aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay)) + 
  geom_jitter(width = 30, height = 30)
```

Observe how this function call is identical to the one in Subsection \@ref(geompoint), but with `geom_point()` replaced with `geom_jitter()`. Also, it is important to note that `geom_jitter()` is strictly a visualization tool and that does not alter the original values saved in `jitter_example`.

The plot in Figure \@ref(fig:jitter) helps us a little bit in getting a sense for the overplotting, but with a relatively large data-set like this one (`r nrow(alaska_flights)` flights), it can be argued that changing the transparency of the points by setting `alpha` proved more effective. 

Furthermore, we'll see later on that the two following R commands will yield the exact same plot:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = alaska_flights, 
       mapping = aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay)) + 
  geom_jitter(width = 30, height = 30)
```

In other words you can drop the `data =` and `mapping =` if you keep the order of the two arguments the same. Since the `ggplot()` function is expecting its first argument `data` to be a data frame and its second argument to correspond to `mapping = `, you can omit both and you'll get the same plot.  As you get more and more practice, you'll likely find yourself not including the specification of the argument like this.  But for now to keep things straightforward let's make it a point to include the `data =` and `mapping =`. 

```{block lc-overplotting, type='learncheck', purl=FALSE}
**_Learning check_**
```

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`**  Why is setting the `alpha` argument value useful with scatterplots? What further information does it give you that a regular scatterplot cannot?

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** After viewing the Figure \@ref(fig:alpha) above, give an approximate range of arrival delays and departure delays that occur the most frequently.  How has that region changed compared to when you observed the same plot without the `alpha = 0.2` set in Figure \@ref(fig:noalpha)?

```{asis lc-overplotting-solutions, include=show_solutions('3-3')}
**Learning Check Solutions**  
**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc - 1), ")")`**: Why is setting the `alpha` argument value useful with scatterplots? What further information does it give you that a regular scatterplot cannot? *It thins out the points so we address overplotting. But more importantly it hints at the (statistical) **density** and **distribution** of the points: where are the points concentrated, where do they occur. We will see more about densities and distributions in Chapter 6 when we switch gears to statistical topics.*
  
**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc), ")")`**: After viewing the Figure \@ref(fig:alpha) above, give a range of arrival delays and departure delays that occur most frequently?  How has that region changed compared to when you observed the same plot without the `alpha = 0.2` set in Figure \@ref(fig:noalpha)? *The lower plot suggests that most Alaska flights from NYC depart between 12 minutes early and on time and arrive between 50 minutes early and on time.*  

```

```{block, type='learncheck', purl=FALSE}
```

### Summary

Scatterplots display the relationship between two numerical variables.  They are among the most commonly used plots because they can provide an immediate way to see the trend in one variable versus another.  However, if you try to create a scatterplot where either one of the two variables is not numerical, you will get strange results.  Be careful!

With medium to large data-sets, you may need to play with either `geom_jitter()` or the `alpha` argument in order to get a good feel for relationships in your data.  This tweaking is often a fun part of data visualization since you'll have the chance to see different relationships come about as you make subtle changes to your plots.






## 5NG#2: Linegraphs {#linegraphs}

The next of the 5NG is a linegraph.  They are most frequently used when the x-axis represents time and the y-axis represents some other numerical variable; such plots are known as *time series*.  Time represents a variable that is connected together by each day following the previous day.  In other words, time has a natural ordering.  Linegraphs should be avoided when there is not a clear sequential ordering to the explanatory variable, i.e. the x-variable or the *predictor* variable.

Our focus now turns to the `temp` variable in this `weather` data-set. By

* Looking over the `weather` data-set by typing `View(weather)` in the console. 
* Running `?weather` to bring up the help file.

We can see that the `temp` variable corresponds to hourly temperature (in Fahrenheit) recordings at weather stations near airports in New York City. Instead of considering all hours in 2013 for all three airports in NYC, let's focus on the hourly temperature at Newark airport (`origin` code "EWR") for the first 15 days in January 2013. The `weather` data frame in the `nycflights13` package contains this data, but we first need to filter it to only include those rows that correspond to Newark in the first 15 days of January.

```{r}
early_january_weather <- weather %>% 
  filter(origin == "EWR" & month == 1 & day <= 15)
```

This is similar to the previous use of the `filter` command in Section \@ref(scatterplots), however we now use the `&` operator. The above selects only those rows in `weather` where the originating airport is `"EWR"` **and** we are in the first month **and** the day is from 1 to 15 inclusive.  
     

```{block lc-early_january_weather, type='learncheck', purl=FALSE}
**_Learning check_**
```

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** Take a look at both the `weather` and `early_january_weather` data frames by running `View(weather)` and `View(early_january_weather)` in the console. In what respect do these data frames differ?

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** `View()` the `flights` data frame again. Why does the `time_hour` variable uniquely identify the hour of the measurement whereas the `hour` variable does not? 

```{asis lc-early_january_weather-solutions, include=show_solutions('3-4')}
**Learning Check Solutions**  
**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc - 1), ")")`**: Take a look at both the `weather` and `early_january_weather` data frames by running `View(weather)` and `View(early_january_weather)` in the console. In what respect do these data frames differ? *The rows of `early_january_weather` are a subset of `weather`.*  
**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc), ")")`**: `View()` the `flights` data frame again. Why does the `time_hour` variable correctly identify the hour of the measurement whereas the `hour` variable does not? *Because to uniquely identify an hour, we need the `year`/`month`/`day`/`hour` sequence, whereas there are only 24 possible `hour`'s.*  
```

```{block, type='learncheck', purl=FALSE}
```

### Linegraphs via geom_line {#geomline}

We plot a linegraph of hourly temperature using `geom_line()`:

```{r hourlytemp, fig.cap="Hourly Temperature in Newark for January 1-15, 2013"}
ggplot(data = early_january_weather, 
       mapping = aes(x = time_hour, y = temp)) +
  geom_line()
```

Much as with the `ggplot()` call in Chapter \@ref(geompoint), we describe the components of the Grammar of Graphics:

* Within the `ggplot()` function call, we specify two of the components of the grammar:
    1. The `data` frame to be `early_january_weather` by setting `data = early_january_weather`
    1. The `aes`thetic mapping by setting `aes(x = time_hour, y = temp)`. Specifically
        * `time_hour` (i.e. the time variable) maps to the `x` position
        * `temp` maps to the `y` position
* We add a layer to the `ggplot()` function call using the `+` sign
* The layer in question specifies the third component of the grammar:  the `geom`etric object in question. In this case the geometric object is a `line`, set by specifying `geom_line()`. 


```{block lc-linegraph, type='learncheck', purl=FALSE}
**_Learning check_**
```

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`**  Why should linegraphs be avoided when there is not a clear ordering of the horizontal axis?

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** Why are linegraphs frequently used when time is the explanatory variable?

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** Plot a time series of a variable other than `temp` for Newark Airport in the first 15 days of January 2013.

```{asis lc-linegraph-solutions, include=show_solutions('3-5')}
**Learning Check Solutions**  
**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc - 2), ")")`**: Why should linegraphs be avoided when there is not a clear ordering of the horizontal axis? *Because lines suggest connectedness and ordering.*  
**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc - 1), ")")`**: Why are linegraphs frequently used when time is the explanatory variable? *Because time is sequential: subsequent observations are closely related to each other.*  
**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc), ")")`**: Plot a time series of a variable other than `temp` for Newark Airport in the first 15 days of January 2013. *Humidity is a good one to look at, since this very closely related to the cycles of a day.*  
```

```{r, include=show_solutions('3-5'), echo=show_solutions('3-5')}
ggplot(data = early_january_weather, mapping = aes(x = time_hour, y = humid)) +
  geom_line()
```

```{block, type='learncheck', purl=FALSE}
```

### Summary

Linegraphs, just like scatterplots, display the relationship between two numerical variables. However, the variable on the x-axis (i.e. the explanatory variable) should have a natural ordering, like some notion of time.  We can mislead our audience if that isn't the case.






## 5NG#3: Histograms {#histograms}

Let's consider the `temp` variable in the `weather` data frame once again, but now unlike with the linegraphs in Chapter \@ref(linegraphs), let's say we don't care about the relationship of temperature to time, but rather we care about the *(statistical) distribution* of temperatures. We could just produce points where each of the different values appear on something similar to a number line:

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=0.8, fig.cap="Plot of Hourly Temperature Recordings from NYC in 2013"}
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = temp, y = factor("A"))) +
  geom_point() +
  theme(axis.ticks.y = element_blank(), 
        axis.title.y = element_blank(),
        axis.text.y = element_blank())
hist_title <- "Histogram of Hourly Temperature Recordings from NYC in 2013"
```

This gives us a general idea of how the values of `temp` differ.  We see that temperatures vary from around `r round(min(weather$temp, na.rm = TRUE), 0)` up to `r round(max(weather$temp, na.rm = TRUE), 0)` degrees Fahrenheit.  The area between 40 and 60 degrees appears to have more points plotted than outside that range.

### Histograms via geom_histogram {#geomhistogram}

What is commonly produced instead of the above plot is a plot known as a *histogram*.  The histogram shows how many elements of a single numerical variable fall in specified *bins*.  In this case, these bins may correspond to between 0-10&deg;F, 10-20&deg;F, etc. We produce a histogram of the hour temperatures at all three NYC airports in 2013:

```{r, warning=TRUE, fig.cap=hist_title}
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = temp)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

Note here:

* There is only one variable being mapped in `aes()`: the single numerical variable `temp`. You don't need to compute the y-aesthetic: it gets computed automatically.
* We set the `geom`etric object to be `geom_histogram()`
* We got a warning message of `1 rows containing non-finite values` being removed. This is due to one of the values of temperature being missing. R is alerting us that this happened.  
* Another warning corresponds to an urge to specify the number of bins you'd like to create.

### Adjusting the bins {#adjustbins}

We can adjust characteristics of the bins in one of *two* ways:

1. By adjusting the number of bins via the `bins` argument
1. By adjusting the width of the bins via the `binwidth` argument

First, we have the power to specify how many bins we would like to put the data into as an argument in the `geom_histogram()` function.  By default, this is chosen to be 30 somewhat arbitrarily; we have received a warning above our plot that this was done.

```{r fig.cap=paste(hist_title, "- 60 Bins")}
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = temp)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 60, color = "white")
```

Note the addition of the `color` argument.  If you'd like to be able to more easily differentiate each of the bins, you can specify the color of the outline as done above. You can also adjust the color of the bars by setting the `fill` argument. Type `colors()` in your console to see all `r length(colors())` available colors.
  
```{r fig.cap=paste(hist_title, "- 60 Colored Bins")}
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = temp)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 60, color = "white", fill = "steelblue")
```

Second, instead of specifying the number of bins, we can also specify the width of the bins by using the `binwidth` argument in the `geom_histogram` function. 

```{r fig.cap=paste(hist_title, "- Binwidth = 10"), fig.height=5}
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = temp)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, color = "white")
```

```{block lc-histogram, type='learncheck', purl=FALSE}
**_Learning check_**
```

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** What does changing the number of bins from 30 to 60 tell us about the distribution of temperatures?

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** Would you classify the distribution of temperatures as symmetric or skewed?

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** What would you guess is the "center" value in this distribution?  Why did you make that choice?

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** Is this data spread out greatly from the center or is it close?  Why?


```{asis lc-histogram-solutions, include=show_solutions('3-7')}
**Learning Check Solutions**  
**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc - 3), ")")`: What does changing the number of bins from 30 to 60 tell us about the distribution of temperatures?** The distribution doesn't change much. But by refining the bin width, we see that the temperature data has a high degree of accuracy. What do I mean by accuracy? Looking at the `temp` variabile by `View(weather)`, we see that the precision of each temperature recording is 2 decimal places.

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc - 2), ")")`: Would you classify the distribution of temperatures as symmetric or skewed?** It is rather symmetric, i.e. there are no __long tails__ on only one side of the distribution

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc - 1), ")")`: What would you guess is the "center" value in this distribution?  Why did you make that choice?** The center is around `r mean(weather$temp, na.rm=TRUE)`&deg;F. By running the `summary()` command, we see that the mean and median are very similar. In fact, when the distribution is symmetric the mean equals the median.

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc), ")")`: Is this data spread out greatly from the center or is it close? Why?**

This can only be answered relatively speaking! Let's pick things to be relative to Seattle, WA temperatures:

![](images/temp.png)

While, it appears that Seattle weather has a similar center of 55&deg;F, its
temperatures are almost entirely between 35&deg;F and 75&deg;F for a range of
about 40&deg;F. Seattle temperatures are much less spread out than New York i.e.
much more consistent over the year. New York on the other hand has much colder
days in the winter and much hotter days in the summer. Expressed differently,
the middle 50% of values, as delineated by the interquartile range is 30&deg;F:
```

```{r, echo=show_solutions('3-7'), include=show_solutions('3-7'), message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
IQR(weather$temp, na.rm=TRUE)
```

```{r, echo=show_solutions('3-7'), include=show_solutions('3-7'), message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
summary(weather$temp)
```

```{block, type='learncheck', purl=FALSE}
```

### Summary

Histograms, unlike scatterplots and linegraphs, present information on only a single numerical variable. In particular they are visualizations of the (statistical) distribution of values. 






## Facets {#facets}

Before continuing the 5NG, we briefly introduce a new concept called *faceting*.  Faceting is used when we'd like to create small multiples of the same plot over a different categorical variable.  By default, all of the small multiples will have the same vertical axis. 

For example, suppose we were interested in looking at how the temperature histograms we saw in Chapter \@ref(histograms) varied by month.  This is what is meant by "the distribution of a variable over another variable": `temp` is one variable and `month` is the other variable. In order to look at histograms of `temp` for each month, we add a layer `facet_wrap(~ month)`.  You can also specify how many rows you'd like the small multiple plots to be in using `nrow` or how many columns using `ncol` inside of `facet_wrap`.

```{r facethistogram, fig.cap="Faceted histogram"}
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = temp)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, color = "white") +
  facet_wrap(~ month, nrow = 4)
```

Note the use of the `~` before `month` in `facet_wrap`.  The tilde (`~`) is required and you'll receive the error `Error in as.quoted(facets) : object 'month' not found` if you don't include it before `month` here.

As we might expect, the temperature tends to increase as summer approaches and then decrease as winter approaches.

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** What other things do you notice about the faceted plot above?  How does a faceted plot help us see relationships between two variables?

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** What do the numbers 1-12 correspond to in the plot above?  What about 25, 50, 75, 100?

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** For which types of data-sets would these types of faceted plots not work well in comparing relationships between variables? Give an example describing the nature of these variables and other important characteristics.

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** Does the `temp` variable in the `weather` data-set have a lot of variability?  Why do you say that?

```{asis lc-facet-solutions, include=show_solutions('3-8')}
**Learning Check Solutions**  
**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc - 3), ")")`: What other things do you notice about the faceted plot above? How does a faceted plot help us see relationships between two variables?** 
  
* Certain months have much more consistent weather (August in particular), while others have crazy variability like January and October, representing changes in the seasons.
* Because we see `temp` recordings split by `month`, we are considering the relationship between these two variables. For example, for example for summer months, temperatures tend to be higher. 
    
**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc - 2), ")")`: What do the numbers 1-12 correspond to in the plot above? What about 25, 50, 75, 100?**
  
* While month is technically a number between 1-12, we're viewing it as a categorical variable here. Specifically an **ordinal categorical** variable since there is a ordering to the categories
* 25, 50, 75, 100 are temperatures

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc - 1), ")")`: For which types of datasets would these types of faceted plots not work well in comparing relationships between variables? Give an example describing the variability of the variables and other important characteristics?** Having histograms split by day would not be great:

* We'd have 365 facets to look at. Way to many.
* We don't really care about day-to-day fluctuation in weather so much, but maybe more week-to-week variation. We'd like to focus on seasonal trends.

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc), ")")`: Does the `temp` variable in the `weather` dataset have a lot of variability? Why do you say that?**
Again, like in LC `r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc-4), ")")`, this is a relative question. I would say yes, because in New York City, you have 4 clear seasons with different weather. Whereas in Seattle WA and Portland OR, you have two seasons: summer and rain!

```

```{block, type='learncheck', purl=FALSE}
```







## 5NG#4: Boxplots {#boxplots}

While using faceted histograms can provide a way to compare distributions of a numerical variable split by groups of a categorical variable as in Section \@ref(facets), an alternative plot called a *boxplot* (also called a *side-by-side boxplot*) achieves the same task and is frequently preferred.  The *boxplot* uses the information provided in the *five-number summary* referred to in Appendix \@ref(appendixA).  It gives a way to compare this summary information across the different levels of a categorical variable.  

### Boxplots via geom_boxplot {#geomboxplot}

Let's create a boxplot to compare the monthly temperatures as we did above with the faceted histograms.

```{r badbox, fig.cap="Invalid boxplot specification", fig.height=3.5}
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = month, y = temp)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

```
Warning messages:
1: Continuous x aesthetic -- did you forget aes(group=...)? 
2: Removed 1 rows containing non-finite values (stat_boxplot). 
```

Note the set of warnings that is given here. The second warning corresponds to missing values in the data frame and it is turned off on subsequent plots. Let's focus on the first warning. 

Observe that this plot does not look like what we were expecting.  We were expecting to see the distribution of temperatures for each month (so 12 different boxplots).  The first warning is letting us know that we are plotting a numerical, and not categorical variable, on the x-axis. This gives us the overall boxplot without any other groupings.  We can get around this by introducing a new function for our `x` variable:

```{r monthtempbox, fig.cap="Month by temp boxplot", fig.height=3.7}
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = factor(month), y = temp)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

We have introduced a new function called `factor()` which converts a numerical variable to a categorical one. This is necessary as `geom_boxplot` requires the `x` variable to be a categorical variable, which the variable `month` is not. So after applying `factor(month)`, month goes from having numerical values 1, 2, ..., 12 to having labels "1", "2", ..., "12." The resulting Figure \@ref(fig:monthtempbox) shows 12 separate "box and whiskers" plots with the following features:

* The "box" portions of this plot represent the 25^th^ percentile AKA the 1^st^ quartile, the median AKA the 50^th^ percentile AKA the 2^nd^ quartile, and the 75^th^ percentile AKA the 3^rd^ quartile.
* The height of each box, i.e. the value of the 3^rd^ quartile minus the value of the 1^st^ quartile, is called the *interquartile range* ($IQR$). It is a measure of spread of the middle 50% of values, with longer boxes indicating more variability.
* The "whisker" portions of these plots extend out from the bottoms and tops of the boxes and represent points less than the 25^th^ percentile and greater than the 75^th^ percentiles respectively. They're set to extend out no more than $1.5 \times IQR$ units away from either end of the boxes. We say "no more than" because the ends of the whiskers represent the first observed values of `temp` to be within the range of the whiskers. The length of these whiskers show how the data outside the middle 50% of values vary, with longer whiskers indicating more variability.
* The dots representing values falling outside the whiskers are called *outliers*. It is important to keep in mind that the definition of an outlier is somewhat arbitrary and not absolute. In this case, they are defined by the length of the whiskers, which are no more than $1.5 \times IQR$ units long.

Looking at this plot we can see, as expected, that summer months (6 through 8) have higher median temperatures as evidenced by the higher solid lines in the middle of the boxes. We can easily compare temperatures across months by drawing imaginary horizontal lines across the plot. Furthermore, the height of the 12 boxes as quantified by the interquartile ranges are informative too; they tell us about variability, or spread, of temperatures recorded in a given month. 

But to really bring home what boxplots show, let's focus only on the month of November's `r weather %>% filter(month == 11) %>% nrow()` temperature recordings.

```{r monthtempbox2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="November boxplot", fig.height=3.7}
weather %>% 
  filter(month %in% c(11)) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = factor(month), y = temp)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

Now let's plot all `r weather %>% filter(month == 11) %>% nrow()` temperature recordings for November on top of the boxplot in Figure \@ref(fig:monthtempbox3). 

```{r monthtempbox3, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="November boxplot with points", fig.height=3.7}
quartiles <- weather %>% filter(month == 11) %>% pull(temp) %>% quantile(prob=c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75))
weather %>% 
  filter(month %in% c(11)) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = factor(month), y = temp)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.05, height = 0.5, alpha = 0.2)
```

What the boxplot does is summarize the `r weather %>% filter(month == 11) %>% nrow()` points for you, in particular:
  
1. 25% of points (about 534 observations) fall below the bottom edge of the box which is the first quartile of `r quartiles[1] %>% round(3)` degrees Fahrenheit (2.2 degrees Celsius). In other words 25% of observations were colder than `r quartiles[1] %>% round(3)` degrees Fahrenheit.
1. 25% of points fall between the bottom edge of the box and the solid middle line which is the median of `r quartiles[2] %>% round(3)` degrees Fahrenheit (7.8 degrees Celsius). In other words 25% of observations were between `r quartiles[1] %>% round(3)` and `r quartiles[2] %>% round(3)` degrees Fahrenheit.
1. 25% of points fall between the solid middle line and the top edge of the box which is the third quartile of `r quartiles[3] %>% round(3)` degrees Fahrenheit (11.1 degrees Celsius). In other words 25% of observations were between `r quartiles[2] %>% round(3)` and `r quartiles[3] %>% round(3)` degrees Fahrenheit.
1. 25% of points fall over the top edge of the box. In other words 25% of observations were warmer than `r quartiles[3] %>% round(3)` degrees Fahrenheit.
1. The middle 50% of points lie within the interquartile range `r (quartiles[3] - quartiles[1]) %>% round(3)` degrees Fahrenheit.

It appears to be an outlier. Let's revisit the use of the `filter` command to hone in on it. We want all data points where the `month` is 5 and `temp<25`
```

weather %>% 
  filter(month==5 & temp < 25)
```



```{asis, include=show_solutions('3-9')}
There appears to be only one hour and only at JFK that recorded 13.1 F (-10.5 C) in the month of May. This is probably a data entry mistake!
Why wasn't the weather at least similar at EWR (Newark) and LGA (La Guardia)?

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc - 2), ")")`: Which months have the highest variability in temperature? What reasons do you think this is?**
We are now interested in the **spread** of the data. One measure some of you may have seen previously is the standard deviation. But in this plot we can read off the Interquartile Range (IQR):

* The distance from the 1st to the 3rd quartiles i.e. the length of the boxes
* You can also think of this as the spread of the **middle 50%** of the data

Just from eyeballing it, it seems

* November has the biggest IQR, i.e. the widest box, so has the most variation in temperature
* August has the smallest IQR, i.e. the narrowest box, so is the most consistent temperature-wise

Here's how we compute the exact IQR values for each month (we'll see this more in depth Chapter 5 of the text):

1. `group` the observations by `month` then
1. for each `group`, i.e. `month`, `summarize` it by applying the summary statistic function `IQR()`, while making sure to skip over missing data via `na.rm=TRUE` then
1. `arrange` the table in `desc`ending order of `IQR`
```

```{r, echo=show_solutions('3-9'), eval=FALSE}
weather %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarize(IQR = IQR(temp, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(IQR))
```
```{r, echo=FALSE, include=show_solutions('3-9')}
weather %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarize(IQR = IQR(temp, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(IQR)) %>%
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling(font_size = ifelse(knitr:::is_latex_output(), 10, 16),
                latex_options = c("HOLD_position"))
```

```{asis, include=show_solutions('3-9')}
**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc - 1), ")")`: We looked at the distribution of a numerical variable over a categorical variable here with this boxplot. Why can't we look at the distribution of one numerical variable over the distribution of another numerical variable? Say, temperature across pressure, for example?**
Because we need a way to group many numerical observations together, say by grouping by month. For pressure, we have near unique values for pressure, i.e. no groups, so we can't make boxplots.

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc), ")")`: Boxplots provide a simple way to identify outliers. Why may outliers be easier to identify when looking at a boxplot instead of a faceted histogram?**
In a histogram, the bin corresponding to where an outlier lies may not by high enough for us to see. In a boxplot, they are explicitly labelled separately. 
```

```

### Summary

Boxplots provide a way to compare and contrast the distribution of one quantitative variable across multiple levels of one categorical variable. One can see where the median falls across the different groups by looking at the center line in the box. To see how spread out the variable is across the different groups, look at both the width of the box and also how far the lines stretch vertically from the box. (If the lines stretch far from the box but the box has a small width, the variability of the values closer to the center is much smaller than the variability of the outer ends of the variable.) Outliers are even more easily identified when looking at a boxplot than when looking at a histogram.






## 5NG#5: Barplots {#geombar}

Both histograms and boxplots represent ways to visualize the variability of numerical variables. Another common task is to present the distribution of a categorical variable. This is a simpler task, focused on how many elements from the data fall into different categories of the categorical variable. Often the best way to visualize these different counts (also known as *frequencies*) is via a barplot, also known as a barchart.

One complication, however, is how your data is represented: is the categorical variable of interest "pre-counted" or not? For example, run the following code in your Console. This code manually creates two data frames representing a collection of fruit: 3 apples and 2 oranges.

```{r}
fruits <- data_frame(
  fruit = c("apple", "apple", "apple", "orange", "orange")
)
fruits_counted <- data_frame(
  fruit = c("apple", "orange"),
  number = c(3, 2)
)
```

We see both the `fruits` and `fruits_counted` data frames represent the same collection of fruit. Whereas `fruits` just lists the fruit individually:

```{r fruits, echo=FALSE}
kable(
    fruits,
    digits=2,
    caption = "Fruits", 
    booktabs = TRUE
  ) %>% 
  kable_styling(font_size = ifelse(knitr:::is_latex_output(), 10, 16),
                latex_options = c("HOLD_position"))
```

`fruits_counted` has a variable `count` which represents pre-counted values of each fruit. 

```{r fruitscounted, echo=FALSE}
kable(
    fruits_counted,
    digits=2,
    caption = "Fruits (Pre-Counted)", 
    booktabs = TRUE
  ) %>% 
  kable_styling(font_size = ifelse(knitr:::is_latex_output(), 10, 16),
                latex_options = c("HOLD_position"))
```

### Barplots via geom_bar/geom_col

Let's generate barplots using these two different representations of the same basket of fruit: 3 apples and 2 oranges. Using the not pre-counted data `fruits` from Table \@ref(tab:fruits):

```{r geombar, fig.cap="Barplot when counts are not pre-counted", fig.height=2.5}
ggplot(data = fruits, mapping = aes(x = fruit)) +
  geom_bar()
```

and using the pre-counted data `fruits_counted` from Table \@ref(tab:fruitscounted):

```{r, geomcol, fig.cap="Barplot when counts are pre-counted", fig.height=2.5}
ggplot(data = fruits_counted, mapping = aes(x = fruit, y = number)) +
  geom_col()
```

Compare the barplots in Figures \@ref(fig:geombar) and \@ref(fig:geomcol), which are identical, but are based on the two different data frames. Observe that:

* The code that generates Figure \@ref(fig:geombar) based on `fruits` does not map a variable to the `y` `aes`thetic and uses `geom_bar()`.
* The code that generates Figure \@ref(fig:geomcol) based on `fruits_counted` maps the `number` variable to the `y` `aes`thetic and uses `geom_col()`

Stating the above differently:

* When the categorical variable you want to plot is not pre-counted in your data frame you need to use `geom_bar()`.
* When the categorical variable is pre-counted (in the above `fruits_counted` example in the variable `number`), you need to use `geom_col()` with the `y` aesthetic explicitly mapped.

Please note that understanding this difference is one of `ggplot2`'s trickier aspects that causes the most confusion, and fortunately this is as complicated as our use of `ggplot2` is going to get. Let's consider a different distribution: the distribution of airlines that flew out of New York City in 2013.  Here we explore the number of flights from each airline/`carrier`.  This can be plotted by invoking the `geom_bar` function in `ggplot2`:

(ref:geombar) Number of flights departing NYC in 2013 by airline using geom_bar

```{r flightsbar, fig.cap='(ref:geombar)', fig.height=2.5}
ggplot(data = flights, mapping = aes(x = carrier)) +
  geom_bar()
```

To get an understanding of what the names of these airlines are corresponding to these `carrier` codes, we can look at the `airlines` data frame in the `nycflights13` package.  

```{r, eval=FALSE}
airlines
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
kable(airlines) %>% 
  kable_styling(font_size = ifelse(knitr:::is_latex_output(), 10, 16),
                latex_options = c("HOLD_position"))
```

Going back to our barplot, we see that United Air Lines, JetBlue Airways, and ExpressJet Airlines had the most flights depart New York City in 2013.  To get the actual number of flights by each airline we can use the `group_by()`, `summarize()`, and `n()` functions in the `dplyr` package on the `carrier` variable in `flights`, which we will introduce formally in Chapter \@ref(wrangling).

```{r message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
flights_table <- flights %>% 
  group_by(carrier) %>% 
  summarize(number = n())
flights_table
```
```{r message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
flights_table <- flights %>% 
  group_by(carrier) %>% 
  summarize(number = n())
kable(flights_table) %>% 
  kable_styling(font_size = ifelse(knitr:::is_latex_output(), 10, 16),
                latex_options = c("HOLD_position"))
```

In this table, the counts of the carriers are pre-counted. To create a barplot using the data frame `flights_table`, we

* use `geom_col()` instead of `geom_bar()`
* map the `y` aesthetic to the variable `number`.

Compare this barplot using `geom_col` in Figure \@ref(fig:flightscol) with the earlier barplot using `geom_bar` in Figure \@ref(fig:flightsbar). They are identical. However the input data we used for these are different. 

(ref:geomcol) Number of flights departing NYC in 2013 by airline using geom_col

```{r flightscol, fig.cap='(ref:geomcol)', fig.height=2.5}
ggplot(data = flights_table, mapping = aes(x = carrier, y = number)) +
  geom_col()
```


<!--
**Technical note**: Refer to the use of `::` in both lines of code above.  This is another way of ensuring the correct function is called.  A `count` exists in a couple different packages and sometimes you'll receive strange errors when a different instance of a function is used.  This is a great way of telling R that "I want this one!".  You specify the name of the package directly before the `::` and then the name of the function immediately after `::`.

### Must avoid pie charts!

Unfortunately, one of the most common plots seen today for categorical data is the pie chart.  While they may seem harmless enough, they actually present a problem in that humans are unable to judge angles well.  As Naomi Robbins describes in her book "Creating More Effective Graphs" [@robbins2013], we overestimate angles greater than 90 degrees and we underestimate angles less than 90 degrees.  In other words, it is difficult for us to determine relative size of one piece of the pie compared to another.  

Let's examine our previous barplot example on the number of flights departing NYC by airline.  This time we will use a pie chart.  As you review this chart, try to identify 

- how much larger the portion of the pie is for ExpressJet Airlines (`EV`)  compared to US Airways (`US`), 
- what the third largest carrier is in terms of departing flights, and
- how many carriers have fewer flights than United Airlines (`UA`)?


```{r carrierpie, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The dreaded pie chart", fig.height=5}
ggplot(flights, mapping = aes(x = factor(1), fill = carrier)) +
  geom_bar(width = 1) +
  coord_polar(theta = "y") +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(), 
    axis.title.y = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    axis.text.y = element_blank(),
    axis.text.x = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(keywidth = 0.8, keyheight = 0.8))
```

While it is quite easy to look back at the barplot to get the answer to these questions, it's quite difficult to get the answers correct when looking at the pie graph.  Barplots can always present the information in a way that is easier for the eye to determine relative position.  There may be one exception from Nathan Yau at [FlowingData.com][fd] but we will leave this for the reader to decide:

### Using barplots to compare two categorical variables

Barplots are the go-to way to visualize the frequency of different categories of a categorical variable. They make it easy to order the counts and to compare the frequencies of one group to another. Another use of barplots (unfortunately, sometimes inappropriately and confusingly) is to compare two categorical variables together.  Let's examine the distribution of outgoing flights from NYC by `carrier` and `airport`.

We begin by getting the names of the airports in NYC that were included in the `flights` data-set. Here, we preview the `inner_join()` function from Chapter \@ref(wrangling). This function will join the data frame `flights` with the data frame `airports` by matching rows that have the same airport code. However, in `flights` the airport code is included in the `origin` variable whereas in `airports` the airport code is included in the `faa` variable. We will revisit such examples in Section \@ref(joins) on joining data-sets.


```{r message=FALSE}
flights_namedports <- flights %>% 
  inner_join(airports, by = c("origin" = "faa"))
```

After running `View(flights_namedports)`, we see that `name` now corresponds to the name of the airport as referenced by the `origin` variable.  We will now plot `carrier` as the horizontal variable.  When we specify `geom_bar`, it will specify `count` as being the vertical variable.  A new addition here is `fill = name`.  Look over what was produced from the plot to get an idea of what this argument gives.

```{r, fig.cap="Stacked barplot comparing the number of flights by carrier and airport", fig.height=3.5}
ggplot(data = flights_namedports, 
       mapping = aes(x = carrier, fill = name)) +
  geom_bar()
```

This plot is what is known as a *stacked barplot*.  While simple to make, it often leads to many problems. For example in this plot, it is difficult to compare the heights of the different colors (corresponding to the number of flights from each airport) between the bars (corresponding to the different carriers).

Note that `fill` is an `aes`thetic just like `x` is an `aes`thetic, and thus must be included within the parentheses of the `aes()` mapping. The following code, where the `fill` `aes`thetic is specified on the outside will yield an error. This is a fairly common error that new `ggplot` users make:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = flights_namedports, 
       mapping = aes(x = carrier), fill = name) +
  geom_bar()
```

```{block lc-barplot-two-var, type='learncheck', purl=FALSE}
**_Learning check_**
```

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** What kinds of questions are not easily answered by looking at the above figure?

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** What can you say, if anything, about the relationship between airline and airport in NYC in 2013 in regards to the number of departing flights?

```{asis lc-barplot-two-var-solutions, include=show_solutions('3-12')}
**Learning Check Solutions**
  
* **`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc - 1), ")")` What kinds of questions are not easily answered by looking at the above figure?** Because the red, green, and blue bars don't all start at 0 (only red does), it makes comparing counts hard.
* **`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc), ")")` What can you say, if anything, about the relationship between airline and airport in NYC in 2013 in regards to the number of departing flights?** The different airlines prefer different airports. For example, United is mostly a Newark carrier and JetBlue is a JFK carrier. If airlines didn't prefer airports, each color would be roughly one third of each bar.}

```

```{block, type='learncheck', purl=FALSE}
```

Another variation on the stacked barplot is the *side-by-side barplot* also called a *dodged barplot*.

```{r, fig.cap="Side-by-side AKA dodged barplot comparing the number of flights by carrier and airport", fig.height=5}
ggplot(data = flights_namedports, 
       mapping = aes(x = carrier, fill = name)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge")
```


```{block lc-barplot-stacked, type='learncheck', purl=FALSE}
**_Learning check_**
```

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** Why might the side-by-side (AKA dodged) barplot be preferable to a stacked barplot in this case?

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** What are the disadvantages of using a side-by-side (AKA dodged) barplot, in general?

```{asis lc-barplot-stacked-solutions, include=show_solutions('3-13')}
**Learning Check Solutions**
  
* **`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc - 1), ")")` Why might the side-by-side barplot be preferable to a stacked barplot in this case?** We can easily compare the different aiports for a given carrier using a single comparison line i.e. things are lined up
* **`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc - 0), ")")` What are the disadvantages of using a side-by-side barplot, in general?** It is hard to get totals for each airline.
```
```{block, type='learncheck', purl=FALSE}
```

Lastly, an often preferred type of barplot is the *faceted barplot*.  We already saw this concept of faceting and small multiples in Section \@ref(facets).  This gives us a nicer way to compare the distributions across both `carrier` and airport/`name`.

```{r facet-bar-vert, fig.cap="Faceted barplot comparing the number of flights by carrier and airport", fig.height=7.5}
ggplot(data = flights_namedports, 
       mapping = aes(x = carrier, fill = name)) +
  geom_bar() +
  facet_wrap(~ name, ncol = 1)
```


```{block lc-barplot-facet, type='learncheck', purl=FALSE}
**_Learning check_**
```

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** Why is the faceted barplot preferred to the side-by-side and stacked barplots in this case?

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** What information about the different carriers at different airports is more easily seen in the faceted barplot?

```{asis lc-barplot-facet-solutions, include=show_solutions('3-14')}
**Learning Check Solutions**  

* **`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc - 1), ")")` Why is the faceted barplot preferred to the side-by-side and stacked barplots in this case?** Not that different than using side-by-side; depends on how you want to organize your presentation.
* **`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc), ")")` What information about the different carriers at different airports is more easily seen in the faceted barplot?** Now we can also compare the different carriers **within** a particular airport easily too. For example, we can read off who the top carrier for each airport is easily using a single horizontal line.
```

```{block, type='learncheck', purl=FALSE}
```



### Summary

Barplots are the preferred way of displaying categorical variables.  They are easy-to-understand and make it easy to compare across groups of a categorical variable.  When dealing with more than one categorical variable, faceted barplots are frequently preferred over side-by-side or stacked barplots.  Stacked barplots are sometimes nice to look at, but it is quite difficult to compare across the levels since the sizes of the bars are all of different sizes.  Side-by-side barplots can provide an improvement on this, but the issue about comparing across groups still must be dealt with.




## Conclusion

### Putting it all together

Let's recap all five of the Five Named Graphs (5NG) in Table \@ref(tab:viz-summary-table) summarizing their differences. Using these 5NG, you'll be able to visualize the distributions and relationships of variables contained in a wide array of datasets. This will be even more the case as we start to map more variables to more of each `geom`etric object's `aes`thetic attribute options, further unlocking the awesome power of the `ggplot2` package.

### What's to come?

In Chapter \@ref(tidy), we'll introduce the concept of "tidy data" and how it is used as a key data format for all the packages we use in this textbook.  You'll see that the concept appears to be simple, but actually can be a little challenging to decipher without careful practice. We'll also investigate how to import CSV (comma-separated value) files into R using the `readr` package.
